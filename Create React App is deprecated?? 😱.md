# Create React App is DeprecatedðŸ¤¯?

**Create React App** used to be an officially supported way to create single-pag React applications. I offered a modern build setup with no configuration. (2022 Toromo, _Getting Started_ https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) However, on 14th February 2025, React anoounced that they are now sunsetting the Create React App.

## 1. What is Create React App?

Create React App was first released back in 2016, to ease the developers by resolving all the hustles when building a new React app such as basic featues like JSX, linters and hot reloading. It was a combination of several tools replacing the community boilerplates that often were difficult to update. (2025 Matt and Ricky, _Sunsetting Create React App_ https://react.dev/blog/2025/02/14/sunsetting-create-react-app)

Basically, anyone could start/build a React application and not worry about everything else by just one line of command;
`npx create-react-app@latest my-app`

## 2. Why is it deprecated?

Although CRA made it easy to get started, there were some limitations that made it difficult to build high performant production apps. In principle, they could solve these problems by essentially evolving it into a framework.
