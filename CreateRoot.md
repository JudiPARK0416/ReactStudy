🔍 Two Ways to Use createRoot in React 18 – What's the Difference?
Since React 18 introduced the new createRoot API to replace the old ReactDOM.render, the way we initialize our React apps has changed slightly. If you've looked around lately, you've probably seen two different styles of using it:

```jsx
// ✅ Style A
createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>
);
```
```jsx
// ✅ Style B
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
At first glance, they look pretty similar… so what’s the actual difference? Let’s break it down.

✅ First, what’s the same?
Both of these approaches do exactly the same thing. They’re both valid ways to initialize and render a React app using the React 18 createRoot API. In both cases:

A root is created with createRoot()

Your <App /> component is rendered using .render()

StrictMode is used to help catch potential issues in development

📌 Difference #1 – Code Style
✔ Style A: Function chaining

```jsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { StrictMode } from 'react';

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>
);
Clean and concise

No need to store the root in a separate variable

Ideal for simple projects or quick demos

✔ Style B: Explicit variable assignment
jsx

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
Stores the root in a variable

Easier to reuse or reference the root later (e.g., unmount, hydrate, etc.)

Often preferred in larger or more complex apps

📌 Difference #2 – Import Style
Style A uses destructured imports (createRoot, StrictMode)

Style B uses namespaced imports (React, ReactDOM)

Functionally, there's no difference — it’s all about consistency and preference.

💡 So... which one should you use?
That depends!

If your team has a coding standard, follow that.

If you're flying solo:

Prefer Style A for cleaner, one-liner setups

Use Style B if you want more clarity and flexibility

Personally, I start with Style B when I’m building something new, and switch to Style A later if the setup stays simple.

✨ Final Thoughts
React 18's createRoot API offers more flexibility in how we bootstrap our apps. In the end, both styles are fine — what matters most is readability, consistency, and team agreement.

So whichever you pick, just stick with it across your project — and you’ll be good to go. 🚀
